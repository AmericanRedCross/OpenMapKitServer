    # Hi @rrlara !!!!

    This is where the Jekyll source files will live. We will publish the output to `/pages` instead of `_site`.

    Right now we have some basic sites in the `/pages` directory, and we're going to want to integrate what
    we've got into the Jekyll setup. _Discussion needed..._

    PS: We're going to want to move `/docs` into `/jekyll` so that they get published as well. Let's figure that out
    once we've got the boilerplate Jekyll site set up.


    ----------------------------------

    # To fire up the jekyll site
    cd jekyll-mdl
    jekyll serve --watch
