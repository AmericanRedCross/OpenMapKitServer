# Public Directory

This is the de-facto public directory in which OpenMapKit Server serves
data and static assets. You can modify the public directory in `settings.js`.

Within the forms directory are several example ODK XForms. These forms
are available from ODK Collect if you enter the `<server_url>/odk` as
your server URL.

Submissions to the open `odk` endpoint are written to the `submissions`
directory.
